# FIFO_project

	• FIFO is a buffer.
	• Used for continuous sequential read/write operation.
	• It is used for communicating two different modules, we can transfer the data from one module to another in a sequence with required speed of operation.
	• Used to synchronize the two modules which are communicating with different speed of operation.

FIFO contains 4 modules
	1. Memory module(RAM)
	2. Counters(Read counter, write counter)
	3. Flag logic(status FULL or EMPTY)
	4. Static memory(addr=0)

Read addresses are generated by the READ POINTER(Counter) and write addresses by the WRITE POINTER(Counter).

FIFO=1(Indicate FIFO is full)
EMPTY=1(Indicate FIFO is empty)
FULL=0(Indicate FIFO is not full, FIFO may be empty or may have some data)
EMPTY=0(Indicate FIFO is not empty, FIFO may be empty or may have some data)

wr_en and rd_en => control signals
